Afterwards, i use stacked bar chart to show job titles by Salary.

Then,i create Gauge charts to show happiness rate with work/life balance.Also for the Salary.

Next, i want to investigate distribution of Survey takers by Countries.Thats why i prefer treemap.

In the end, i create donut chart to show distribution of difficulty level.

Lastly, i recognize that most of the voters who take data ia switching career and their happiness rate is on the middle.
And most of voters, prefer python maybe because of easy usage.
